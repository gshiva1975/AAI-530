Temperature Analysis Report
1. Overview
This report provides an analysis of temperature variations over time using recorded and
predicted values. The data is sourced from the file
predicted_temperatures_2025-02-05_22-39-21.csv and covers multiple years from
2013 to 2017.
2. Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following key variables:
●
●
●
●
●
●
Humidity: The recorded humidity level.
Wind Speed: The recorded wind speed.
Mean Pressure: The atmospheric pressure.
Date (Numeric & Text Format): The recorded date.
Predicted Temperature: The model-predicted temperature values.
Actual Mean Temperature: The recorded mean temperature.
The dataset spans from December 30, 2012, to March 26, 2017, covering multiple years of
weather observations.
3. Temperature Per Month Analysis
The Temperature Per Month Bar Plot visualizes the sum of actual mean temperatures
aggregated by month and year. The data spans five years, with observations categorized into
12 months and broken further into weeks. The stacked bar chart representation highlights the
variations and seasonal temperature trends across different years.
Key insights:
●
●
The sum of actual mean temperatures ranges from 10.0 to 260.6.
Distinct seasonal patterns are visible, with temperature fluctuations aligning with
expected climate variations.
4. Quarterly and Weekly Temperature Predictions
A detailed breakdown of actual mean temperature, humidity, and predicted temperatures is
presented per quarter and week. The stacked bar chart uses color differentiation to highlight
humidity and temperature variations over time.
Observations:
●
●
The temperature variations are evident across different quarters.
The dataset includes filters to segment the data based on months and weeks, providing
refined insights into seasonal trends.
5. Temperature Classification: High vs. Low
A classification approach categorizes actual mean temperature as High or Low, using a
threshold of 15 degrees Celsius. A bar plot visualizes this classification across weeks and
years.
Findings:
●
●
Temperature classification helps in understanding extreme variations.
The majority of weeks show a clear distinction between high and low-temperature
weeks.
6. Forecasting Temperature and Humidity Trends
This visualization captures the trends of actual and predicted temperature along with
humidity levels, segmented by year and week.
Highlights:
●
●
●
A line plot presents the forecasted and actual values.
The dataset includes a Forecast Indicator dimension, differentiating between
actual and estimated values.
Predicted temperature trends follow a smooth trajectory, showing the effectiveness of the
forecasting model.
7. Predictions for 2016 and 2017
A bar plot specifically tracks predicted temperature trends for the years 2016 and 2017. The
dataset is filtered to include only these years, enabling a focused comparison with prior years.
Insights:
●
●
Predicted temperatures range between 22.1 and 247.8.
Trends indicate whether the model effectively captures yearly variations.
8. Target Chart: Predicting Long-Term Trends
The final visualization tracks long-term predicted temperature trends using a line chart. This
data-driven approach aids in identifying macro-level temperature patterns over multiple years.
Key takeaways:
●
●
Predictions align with observed seasonal variations.
The model provides a robust framework for understanding future temperature trends.
